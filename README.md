# 🏠 VR Room Simulation Project

## 📌 Overview


Experience the feeling of living in your own virtual room with interactive elements!

This is my first VR project, which I completed by following a tutorial available on the official Unity website to understand how VR technology works.
I thoroughly enjoyed the learning process and was excited to explore the world of virtual reality.
This project helped me build a foundational understanding of immersive environments and VR interactions.

In this project, a virtual room is simulated where users can:

📺 Watch TV

🔁 Change TV channels

👕 Hang clothes on a hanger

Overall, it creates an immersive experience that closely resembles living in a real room, offering users a personal and interactive virtual space.
